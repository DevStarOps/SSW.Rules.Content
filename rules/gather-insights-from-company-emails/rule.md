## Actionable insights

Collecting data is great, but if you're not creating actionable insights, you're missing out on the real value. Here are some examples of actionable insights you can gain from analyzing company emails:

- **Workload distribution** - Through analyzing company emails, one can assess whether tasks and responsibilities are allocated evenly across teams.
- **Project management** - Email analysis can reveal insights into project timelines, milestones, and communication patterns.
- **Sales** - By examining email exchanges with clients, trends in customer inquiries, preferences, and feedback can be uncovered.
- **Finance** - Financial communication, such as budget discussions, expense approvals, and financial reporting, can be scrutinized for insights into the company's fiscal health and spending patterns.
